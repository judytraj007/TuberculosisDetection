A PyTorch model based on Alexnet that detects if X-Ray images show any manifestations of tuberculosis.

Problem Statement:-TB Detection in Chest Radiograph Using Deep
Learning

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat. The advent of new powerful hardware and
software techniques has triggered attempts to develop computer aided diagnostic systems for
TB detection.
Given chest x-rays you have to classify whether a person is suffering from Tuberculosis or not.
